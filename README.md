# Eco-Climate–Urban Simulator

This project contains a compact set of long-horizon climate simulations exploring how atmospheric greenhouse gases, terrestrial ecosystems, and the built environment interact over centuries. The models are intentionally reduced in form and are designed to highlight feedbacks, delays, and policy-sensitive pathways rather than to produce high-resolution forecasts.

The simulations combine a simple energy-balance climate core with dynamic carbon cycling, including vegetation and soil carbon, long-lived trace gases, and explicit trajectories for urban and road expansion. Built infrastructure influences climate both through an additional heat forcing and by reducing biologically active land, linking infrastructure policy directly to long-term temperature and CO₂ outcomes.

The code is fully transparent, modular, and intended for exploratory analysis, sensitivity testing, and conceptual experimentation.
